            <pre>
            3/7/17
            Used a grian bag and mashed for 45 minutes.
            Put in one DME bag in early before the sparge. After sparge threw in the other.
            Put hops in for 15 minutes. Only boiled for 15 minutes. 
            Cooled and added the yeast.
            OG reads 1.060 but that was measured from the bottom of the brew, sediment likely tainted reading
            3/12/17-Added the Wyeast 3944, Lactobacillus
            First 3 days of fermentation were very active, settled after that.

            <pre>
            1-29-18, First Brew Attempt with new Brewer's Edge (BE) All-Grain Brewing System.
            Placed 3.9 Gallons of strike water in BE, used hot sink tap water. Resulted in temp of 109 degrees at 1755.
            1805, temp is at 129 degrees, 1810 at 143.
            20:03, difficulty keeping temps at steady 150 temp. Changed power to 1000W instead of 1600W.
            Experiencing difficulty sparging and draining malts. Had to move grain around and unblock screen.
            Used too much Rye in the recipe, it is a mess and creating draining issues. 
            This recipe did not turn out well, had to dump out.
