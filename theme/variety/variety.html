        <h4>Stouts</h4>
        <p>Dark colored beers with roasted flavors, chocolate, coffee or burnt notes of those flavors. Typically
            jet-black in color. </p>

        <h4>Porters</h4>
        <p>Another dark beer, they do not have as much bite as the stouts. Porters tend to have a more chocolate flavor
            with less hoppy flavors. </p>

        <h4>Brown Ale's</h4>
        <p>Ale’s that are named for their color. Brown ales are very popular in the United Kingdom. Lighter than a
            porter with flavors or caramel and chocolate.</p>

        <h4>Amber Ale</h4>
        <p>On the beer spectrum, this is considered a balanced beer. Right in the middle of the pack. Most beer drinkers
            will enjoy an amber ale. Amber ales are considered a good brew for beginners as it establishes a baseline
            for how to adjust ingredients and notice small changes.</p>

        <h4>ESB</h4>
        <p>Extra Special Bitter or ESB, blends traditional English ingredients to achieve a malty character with a
            pronounced hop bitterness. Often served from casks in pubs in its native country.</p>

        <h4>Pale Ale</h4>
        <p>Another beer originating from the UK but hugely popular in the United States. More hops than malt when
            compared to the ESB. The American pale ale is even higher in hop flavor than it’s English counterpart. </p>

        <h4>India Pale Ale</h4>
        <p>IPAs get their name from the days when India was a British colony. Beers tended to spoil on the long trip by
            ship from Britain to India. The Brits found a solution, drastically increasing the amount of hops. Hops
            inhibit the growth of bacteria which kept the beer from spoiling. The result was a very bitter beer that
            many to this day find unappealing. Despite that, the popularity of the IPA has taken off in the last decade.
        </p>

        <h4>Pilsner/Lager</h4>
        <p>Pilsner and lagers are both light beers relative to their counterparts. Easy drinking with a very light hop
            profile. American legacy beer such as Budweiser and Coors fall into this category. </p>

        <h4>Hefeweizen</h4>
        <p>A wheat beer originating from Germany. Hefeweizen’s have a unique yeast that offers notes of banana and
            clove. The beer is typically cloudy due to the inability of the yeast to fall out of suspension after
            fermentation.</p>

        <h4>Saison</h4>
        <p>A beer originating from Belgium, Saison has notes of spice, fruits, sourness and bread. Known for having a
            longer fermentation time than other beers. Also known as farmhouse ales owing to the history of unique
            recipes being brewed from farm to farm in Belgium. </p>
