        <p>I’m just going to touch on brewing equipment for a beginner to intermediate beer brewer. There is a vast
            amount of equipment on the market to choose from. Much of it depends on complexity and commitment. Like many
            hobbies, one can spend huge sums of money on the new shiny toys. I consider myself fairly low on the
            spectrum, I'm a brewer who might turn out three different brews in a year for a total of fifteen gallons.
            Some
            homebrewers would consider that a month’s work. </p>

            <h2>Fermentors</h2>
            <p>Fermentors are the vessel/container where the wort is placed and the wort has cooled to near room
                temperatures. This is usually a 6.5 gallon plastic bucket or glass carboy. At this stage the yeast come
                alive and begins feasting on the sweet wort. Normally this process lasts from one to two weeks. An air
                water valve is placed on the top of fermentor which allows CO2 out but nothing else in. With use of a
                glass carboy, one gets to see the process happen where as a plastic bucket is not viewable. </p>

            <h2>Five Gallon Brewpot</h2>
            <p>A large stainless steel pot for boiling the wort on the stovetop. Normal boil times are usually an hour
                or longer. The hops are added in at this step. </p>

            <h2>Hydrometer/Refractometer</h2>
            <p>Hydrometers and Refractometers are tools used to measure the gravity/weight of the brew.
                One measurement is taken before fermentation and the other after fermentation is complete.
                Both tools are relative to the gravity of water. By having both the original gravity measurement and
                final gravity measurement, a brewer can accuarately state the ABV of the brew.
