        <h3>Welcome to my site! It is dedicated to the art and craft of brewing fine beers. I started brewing my own
            beer
            back about 4 years ago. It all started by purchasing a <cite><a
                    href="https://www.dummies.com/food-drink/drinks/beer/homebrewing-how-to-make-your-own-beer/"><i>
                        Brewing For Dummies</i></a></cite> book. At first I was overwhelmed by the process which can be
            quite complex. Fortunately for beginners there are products and methods out there that are geared for
            beginnners. My first brew was a success, I was
            determined to learn more and produce even better beers. On my site you find what main indgrients make up a
            beer, tools of the trade, my recipes and more. I hope you enjoy the site.
            If you have any questions or want to contact me, check out my About Me page. Thanks for stopping by!
