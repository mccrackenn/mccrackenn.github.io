                    <p>Barley, grain in general, makes the biggest contribution to beer. Barely gives the beer it's
                        color, underlying flavor, sweetness,
                        and body. Malting is the process of wetting barley kernels and allowing them to sprout. After
                        the malting process, the barley is now
                        known as malt or barley malt.

                        <p>Hops are pinecone-like flowers that are harvested on enormous trellises. They are in the same
                            family as cannabis. Hops are used
                            for multiple reasons in beer brewing. First they contain acids that act as a bittering agent
                            to counteract the sweet malted barely.
                            These acids also act a preservative that inhibits bacteria growth and keeps beer longer.
                            Lastly hops provide aroma to a beer. Many
                            different types of hops are grown and they each have their own quality/purpose. A beer's
                            bitterness is measured in International
                            Bitterness Units (IBUs) and many brewers have IBUs printed on their labels.</p>

                        <p>Yeast is what drives the fermentation process. Yeast is a simple singe cell in the fungus
                            family that is
                            self-reproducing. Yeast has a huge appetite for sweet liquids and produces tremendous
                            quantities of alcohol and carbon dioxide
                            while feasting on beer wort. Beer wort is the incredibly sweet syrupy liquid that is
                            produced from the malted grains being soaked/boiled in hot water. Hundreds of different
                            types of yeast strains are in use and produce an array of flavors. Yeast determines the
                            classification of a beer. Brewmasters pick a yeast according to the recipe or style of beer
                            they want to make. Yeast is identified as either an ale yeast or a lager yeast. Ale yeast is
                            a top-fermenting strain that functions efficiently in temperatures of 60 to 75 degrees.
                            Lager yeast is a bottom-fermenting strain that functions best in cooler temps of 38 to 52
                            degrees.

                        <p>Water-The quality of water used in brewing cannot be understated because water makes up
                            ninety-five percent of beer. Many brewers, such as the Coors Brewing, frequently advertise
                            the high quality of the Rocky Mountain water used for their beer. Without taking this
                            conversation too far down the rabbit hole into hydrology and chemistry, a basic principle
                            exists that if one’s tap water source is good enough to drink, it’s good enough to use for
                            brewing. The tap water in most areas of the Northwest is of high quality and has not been a
                            concern for my brews, however other regions have what is known as “hard water”. Hard water
                            usually means the water is high in the amount of calcium, magnesium ions and other minerals.
                            These minerals can negatively affect the beer. One can purchase a test kit to determine the
                            amount of minerals in their water and make adjustments via adding agents or other methods.
