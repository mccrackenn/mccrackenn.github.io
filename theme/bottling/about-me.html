    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hello my name is Neil,</p>
    <p><img src="https://bc.instructure.com/users/5308363/files/123066925/preview?verifier=Q3xxeeNhwXUoVu5lFHvGJpHXMxeHFaq7kNkxUFkW"

    <p>I'm at Bellevue College to get a BAS IST in Application Dev. I have previously taken a Web Development
        course through an online college but since it was over 5 years ago, Bellevue College required I take the
        course again. In Programming, I have some knowledge in Python, I took a Professional beginner course through
        UW during the Spring. I'm hoping to continue learning Python as I found the language much easier to
        learn/use than Java. I've also worked extensively in Networking/TCPIP in previous careers. I'm
        hoping this class furthers my knowledge in HTML and CSS.</p>
    <p>I enjoy traveling and hiking with my wife. I'm an avid reader, especially historical novels. I love playing
        baseball. I'm in an adult's league, the PSSBL, that plays 22 games throughout the summer. During the fall and
        winter, when the temperatures are lower, I love to brew my own beer at home. I currently have a cider in the
        fermentor. This is my first attempt at cider. Once a year the local brew supply store gets fresh pressed apples. I was fortunate to get my order in early and pick up 5 gallons
        The apples are not you're grocery variety kind, they're bittersweet apples that are perfect for dry ciders. Cheers!</p>
