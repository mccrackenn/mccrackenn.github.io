        <h2>Carbonation</h2>
        <p class="bottling-p">Carbonating the beer is an often overlooked final step on the way to a delicious homebrew.
            If forgotten or not done properly, it will be sorely missed. Carbonation has been called the spark of beer.
            A properly carbonated beer delivers mouthfeel and aroma. Without it, a beer will simply be flat. There are
            two
            main ways home brewers accomplish this: </p>

                    <h2>Bottling</h2>
                </li>
                <p> Bottling-Enough bottles must be on hand and sanitized to bottle five gallons of beer. Additionally
                    bottle caps and a bottle cap tool must be on hand to fully seal the bottle cap on the lid. A few
                    ounces of priming sugar are added to hot water and dissolved. Then it is poured into the beer and
                    mixed. Each bottle is then filled almost to the top and sealed with a squeeze of the bottle cap
                    tool. The priming sugar provides a little more food for the remaining yeast to create carbon
                    dioxide, which is released once the cap is opened. A minimum of two weeks should be allowed to pass
                    before the brew is ready to refrigerate and drink!</p>
                
                <li><h2>Kegging</h2></li>
                    <p>Many home brewers, including myself, dream of the day when they can switch from bottling to kegging. Cleaning, sanitizing and filling countless bottles of beer is a tedious process, not to mention storing said bottles. Beer in a keg is carbonated by inserting CO2 under high pressure until the beer absorbs the gas. Once the pressure is released, i.e. when the beer is poured into a glass, the pressure is relaxed and causes the beer to fizz. However, kegging comes along with its own drawbacks. The initial investment to buy a keg, a CO2 tank and regulator is expensive plus an additional refrigerator is needed to store the keg to keep the beer cold. Additionally plenty of space is needed to house/store this equipment. </p>
