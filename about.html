        <p>Hello my name is Neil,</p>
        <p><img src="https://bc.instructure.com/users/5308363/files/123066925/preview?verifier=Q3xxeeNhwXUoVu5lFHvGJpHXMxeHFaq7kNkxUFkW"

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I'm at Bellevue College to get a BAS IST in Application Dev.&nbsp; I have previously taken a Web Development
            course through an online college but since it was over 5 years ago, Bellevue College required I take the
            course again. In Programming, I have some knowledge in Python, I took a Professional beginner course through
            UW during the Spring.&nbsp; I'm hoping to continue learning Python as I found the language much easier to
            learn/use than Java.&nbsp; I've also worked extensively in Networking/TCPIP in previous careers.&nbsp; I'm
            hoping this class furthers my knowledge in HTML and CSS.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I enjoy traveling and hiking with my wife. I'm an avid reader, especially historical novels. I love playing
            baseball. I'm in an adult's league, the PSSBL, that plays 22 games throughout the summer.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
